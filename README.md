# font-engineering
This project aims to be a Font Engineering Learning. It is structured as follows:

* [font](./fonts): This is fonts folder. Now, you can find my own developed font to practice.
* [fonttools](./fonttools): Sample to learn how to work with [fonttools](https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
* [fontbakery](.github/workflows/fontbakery-action.yml): Using [fontbakery](https://github.com/fonttools/fontbakery) in a Github Action to run the checks automatically every time a change has been made. It is an example of continuous integration. See [action example](https://github.com/f-actions/font-bakery).
* [doc](./doc): links and information about fonts.

It will be improved as far as my learning grows.
